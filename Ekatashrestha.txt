Hello! My name is Ekata Shrestha. 
I am from Hetauda, Makawanpur. 
And currently studying in Hetauda School of management in 8th sem of BIM department.

My learning journey is going great. 
In the beginning, it was abit tough for me to understand those codes, because for me this topic was completely new.
But as the time passed, i was able to learn many new things from my instructor.
Now, I am practing all the things that my instructor had taught me. 
So, it's being alittle easy for me.
